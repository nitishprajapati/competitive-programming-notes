The most precise definition of "BITMASKING" one could come up with (w.r.t. competitive programming) : 
Bitmasking usually refers to the technique of representing a 'subset' of a set using a bit vector, 
where ith bit of the vector is set iff the corresponding element belongs to the subset.

      |                                                                           |
      |     Eg,                                                                   |
      |     S={a,b,c,d},                                                          |
      |     then bit vector b=(1,0,1,1) would represent the subset Sâ€²={a,c,d}.    |
      |                                                                           |
      +---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 it is useful where ever subsets have to be considered, and is usually needed in competitive programming 
 when all subsets have to be iterated upon. 
 This technique is better than the usual recursive way of generating all subsets because it's easier, 
 saves memory on call stack, and saves the parameter passing hassles.
